# Work_Day_Scheduler

## Description

The motivation for building this application was the desire to create an application that uses moment.js and jQuery to dynamically update HTML and CSS. This application also greatly uses the Web Storage API.

The reason for building this specific project was the need for a daily planner that stores important events in order to effectively manage time.

Moment.js was used for this application in order to display the current time, and also for the purpose of dynamically updating time blocks to display past, present, and future events.
